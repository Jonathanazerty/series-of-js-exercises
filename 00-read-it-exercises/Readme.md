* [01](./01/) By adding the script tag and putting the text into document.write().

* [02](./02/) the first example was internal and this example is external. The variable is named amount and the value of the variable is 20. Below the value was divided by 2 so that makes 20/2 which is 10 and the text was added. 

* [03](./03/) It will become a list going down and start from 1 to 10. As shown in the code it will go up by 1 (i++)

* [04](./04/) I think it will become a list of all those movies going down and start with The Godfather. With numbers as well go up (i++)

* [05](./05/) Again a list of all the movies but this time there will be no capital letters.

* [06](./06/)  Same result, different code. Return is left out, wrapped it into 1 constant and add it into the document.write

* [07](./07/) Same result, different code. Added a constant to make a different constant(lowerCaseMovies) to leave out the capital letters for all the titles of the movies.
